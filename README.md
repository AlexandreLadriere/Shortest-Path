# Shortest-Path (WIP)
[![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/AlexandreLadriere/Shortest-Path.svg)](https://github.com/AlexandreLadriere/Shortest-Path/blob/master/LICENSE)

This project aims to implement some algorithms for finding the shortest path between a starting point and an end point in a matrix with obstacles, and to illustrate the solutions through a graphical interface.

For the moment, only the following algorithms have been implemented:
- [Breadth-first Search] (BFS), with and without the possibility to move in diagonals.
